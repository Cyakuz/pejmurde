# Pejmurde - Magazine - Flipbook App
Pejmurde is an application that brings together e-magazines created by Doctor Who fans in Turkey as an archive. The app does not actively publish new magazines. It is designed for tablets and desktop screens and does not have a responsive layout for mobile devices. It is developed using React, jQuery, Turn.js, and Bootstrap libraries.

This app is created for educational purposes. It does not contain any advertisements or have any commercial intentions. The design and code are open for use. I would appreciate your assistance in improving the responsive design and Zoom In features.
